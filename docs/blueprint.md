## Style Guidelines:

- The general use case and request details point toward trust and security. In particular, the goal to create resumes 'that pass ATS screening' requires attention. A dark color scheme conveys security, and it can be serious and sharp without being somber if balanced correctly. Primary color: Saturated purple (#9F5BEE) for creativity and forward-thinking.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) to maintain a professional yet modern aesthetic. Secondary colors: Light purple (#B497D6).
- Accent color: Bright pink (#F72585) for call-to-action buttons and highlights.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a tech-savvy and modern look. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear and readable content.
- Use clean, modern icons from Lucide React, with colorful accents to represent different features and sections. Ensure icons are consistent and intuitive.
- Implement a responsive grid layout using clear sections and cards, optimizing the interface for both desktop and mobile devices. The design should emphasize usability and quick access to key features.
- Incorporate subtle animations to improve user experience. Use transitions, hover effects, and progress animations, to make interactions intuitive.
